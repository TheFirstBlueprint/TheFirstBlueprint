🧭 TheFirstBlueprint (Beta)
TheFirstBlueprint is a visual strategy‑planning platform for competitive robotics teams, built to help teams plan matches, communicate strategy, and align with alliance partners more effectively.

This project is currently in active development and is being shared early as a beta so it can grow with feedback from the robotics community.

🚀 What Is TheFirstBlueprint?
TheFirstBlueprint provides a field‑based planning workspace where teams can:

Place robots on a scaled competition field

Draw paths, routes, and annotations

Organize roles and match flow visually

Step through strategic ideas together

The focus is clarity and preparation, not full physics simulation. It’s designed to make strategy discussions faster, more visual, and easier to understand—especially when coordinating with alliance partners.

🤖 Current Support
✅ FTC (2025–26 DECODE) — planning tools are functional and actively improving

🚧 FRC — support is a work in progress and under active development

New features and refinements are added continuously as the project evolves.

🛠️ Built By
TheFirstBlueprint is built by the Build Lead and Code Lead of Team Sharkans 27272, inspired by real competition challenges around communicating strategy quickly and clearly.

This tool was created to solve problems we experienced ourselves—and we’re excited to keep improving it with community input.

📱 What’s Coming
Expanded FRC planning functionality

Mobile and iPad support

An instructional video for onboarding new users

UI/UX refinements and quality‑of‑life improvements

Additional planning and visualization tools

This repository and the live site will continue to evolve.

💬 Feedback & Contributions
Because this is a beta, feedback is extremely important.
